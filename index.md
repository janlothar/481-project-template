## Project Idea

Our project idea is to develop a web browser targeted specifically towards individuals afflicted with cerebral palsy. People with cerebral palsy tend to have issues with fine motor functions with widely varying degrees of severity and as such have trouble navigating many kinds of user interfaces and among them web browsers that are designed to maximize the webpage estate, making many buttons and other interactive features smaller as a result and often shoving them out of the way or hiding them behind multiple high-focus clicks (clicks that even for everyday users may require moving a mouse with high accuracy or tapping a tiny icon). This is a very functional design decision for general users but a major hindrance for those with disabilities. Our design goal is to bring the most popular features of a web browser front and center in a way that makes it easy for those with this disorder to browse the web easily and comfortably.
 
We expect the system to be used as one would any other web browser; to quickly check information online or for casual browsing during free time. We expect our browser to be mostly used in homes under relaxed conditions where the user can comfortably navigate their favourite websites without feeling under pressure. This means we won’t be putting heavy emphasis on quick access to features, but rather on the ease of accessing those features without having to exert excessive concentration or focus. Of course we’d still like the user to be able to look things up quickly so some features might have a higher priority of use than others, such as bookmarks and web search, but as a whole our main goal for the system is the aforementioned ease of use over speed of use.
