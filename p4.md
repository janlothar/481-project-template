## Introduction

Currently, there is no specific web browser that accomodates people who deal with the challenges of cerebral palsy.  We felt this was a great opportunity to create a browser specifically for this user group.  To first find out what look this browser should have, and the features it implements we need to gather research about our target audience.  We have some initial assumptions that we feel might be a problem for our audience, but only through user research we can confirm this.  Next we will describe the design problem we face going into this project.  

## Design Problem

We designed the browser for people with cerebral palsy, and stakeholders also includes people like friends and families of people with cerebral palsy (who may share a device with them), and medical specialists (who may need to teach their patients how to use the browser).

Cerebral palsy is an umbrella term for disorders affecting a person’s ability to move, with common effects such as limited fine motor control, impaired eyesight and/or hearing. The problem with traditional browsers is that they are designed to be very information dense, making the text and targets small. For someone with limited fine motor control, finding and selecting these targets may be very difficult to do with precision.

Our solution addresses this by using large tiles for options so they are easy to find, and bright contrasting colors to differentiate each option visually. The colors also help with memorization; similar options will have a similar color scheme. For example, the bookmarks option has a deep orange color, and the submenus within the bookmarks (add bookmark, list bookmarks) also have an orange color.

## User Research and Findings

For our user research we used three different methods for gathering information on our user group.  Our methods were Observation, Think-Aloud, and Interviewing.  We felt observation was important to have as a method since it allowed our user to be in his own environment and we were able to see him browse through a conventional web browser.  As we observed his actions while navigating through the browser we asked him to tell us out loud not only what actions he was doing, but also why he was doing them.  We feel that observing his actions as well as his reasonings for why he performed those actions helped develop an idea of our user groups mental model.  Lastly, we interviewed our user to ask him what kind of features he liked in conventional browsers and which he did not.  We feel all of these methods really complemented each other and allowed us to gain a deep understanding of the features we should and shouldn't have in the development of our system.

## Design and Justification

We started off with a long wishlist of things we wanted our system to have, and started our initial prototype from that:

* Fast
* Feature-rich
* Aesthetically pleasing
* Customizable
* **Simple to use**
* **Clear interactions**
* **Quick to navigate**
* Efficient
* Usable outside of target user-base

From this wishlist we chose the three that were most important to use (shown in bold) and went back to our design prototype and changed aspects to fit with these newly prioritized aspects.


#### Simple navigation
It’s Hard for our target user-base to perform complex gestures such as swiping and double-tapping, So we wanted to avoid any navigation methods that use them wherever possible. As an example, our initial idea for the browser window was to drag the bar down to show menu, and drag back up to bring the browser window back. This was refined by adding a button that the user could tap instead, eliminating need to perform the complex gesture.

#### Clear Actions
The target user isn’t able to try out different actions on a page as quickly as a typical user, who would have no problem trying out multiple things on a page (e.g. Swiping icons to see if they have additional properties, Navigating back and forth between menu pages to see how things have changed). It became important that interactable elements are simple and clear in what they can do in order to discourage experimentation, which in our case could result in poor user experience.

#### Visibility (for quick navigation)
What would be a standard menu for a typical user might require a lot of ‘tracking’ from our user-base to find what they were looking for. So when it came to our system, less reading and more recognition became a big design philosophy when designing the interface.

## Conclusions

Throughout our entire project we have tried to integrate a simple design with a rather complex system, like a browser.  One thing we discovered is that tradeoffs are a necessary part of the development of this system.  Making tthings too simple takes away from functionality, and conversely making things too complex distances us from our intended target audience.  We feel we hit a good middle ground in the first iteration of our project.  We have developed a simple tile design that has all the major functionalities one might expect from a conventional browser, but we have also added more features to allow for more functionality.  However, this iteration did not come without its problems which we were quick to identify in our heuristic analysis of our system.  In conclusion, we feel this system is a great prototype that can one day develop into something bigger and better to address the needs people with cerebral palsy have while using the Internet.
